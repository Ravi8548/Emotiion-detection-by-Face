AI-Based Facial Emotion Recognition Project

This project leverages DeepFace, an advanced facial analysis framework, to perform real-time emotion recognition from facial expressions. The system captures live video feed, detects faces, and classifies emotions such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, and more using pretrained deep learning models.

ðŸ”¹ Key Contributions:

Utilized DeepFace to perform real-time facial emotion recognition using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on live camera input.

Integrated with OpenCV to capture and process video frames dynamically.

Built a user-facing interface that changes responses or triggers system events based on the detected facial emotion (e.g., playing music, displaying messages).

Applied multi-model analysis using VGG-Face, Facenet, and EmotionNet backends for high prediction accuracy.

ðŸ”¹ Impact:

Showcased the potential of emotion-aware systems in human-computer interaction, smart environments, and accessibility technologies.

Demonstrated the power of transfer learning and pretrained models to accelerate development and ensure robustness.

Can be extended for applications in mental health monitoring, entertainment personalization, and adaptive user interfaces.

This project exemplifies the practical use of deep learning for facial expression recognition, providing an interactive and intelligent system that responds to human emotion.
