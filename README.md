# Emotiion-detection-by-Face
This project leverages DeepFace, an advanced facial analysis framework, to perform real-time emotion recognition from facial expressions. The system captures live video feed, detects faces, and classifies emotions such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, and more using pretrained deep learning models.
